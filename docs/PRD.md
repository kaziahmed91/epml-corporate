- What is mouza Value, RS BS Khotiyan, Far Ratio ki? Why is east facing more important than west? How can i get my apartment registratered? What documents do i need? Why does it sometimes take longer to register my property than others? Whats the difference in lease land building vs free hold plot building? SO MANY unanswered questions.
